# Search Engines Information Retrieval in Practice

The number of web pages on the World Wide Web has exceeded its billionth page marker.  The ability to retrieve relevant information is an integral and vibrant requirement for all net users.  On the surface, the simplicity and richness of search services provided by web search engines search as Yahoo and Google belies the wealth of underlying information architecture, organization, and archive and retrieval technology.

The three fundamental building blocks to information retrieval and search engines are: (1) identifying targets or search pages, (2) extracting relevant metadata information from these pages, and (3) archive and organize these metadata information for rapid retrieval.  Information architects and engineers are wrought with engineering challenges to achieve these goals.  These challenges include problems relating to scalability, reliability, robustness, and unconstrained search domains.  While many of these challenges have been met one way or another and are presented in the course readings, many remain open-ended research topics.

This course will cover web search engines and their foundation, principles, and elements. The class will include lectures on topics relating specifically to search engine technologies and on supplemental paper reading assignments.

## Course Overview

- **Objective** Students will engage in a team or individual project to leverage the search engine techniques learned during the course (e.g., ranking, crawling, content analysis and detection, and query models).

- **Expectation** The class will include lectures on topics relating to search engine technologies and on supplemental paper reading assignments. Programming assignments will augment the theoretical aspects of information retrieval. Please understand that this is a graduate-level and upper-division engineering course. As such, students are expected to devote a large amount of time to the programming assignments and course project.*

## Learning Objectives

* Understand information retrieval theory
* Understand the makeup of search engine development
* Utilize Open Source tools to develop a complete search engine
* Explore newer information retrieval techniques and technology

## Grading Allocation

There will be quizzes that are based on textbook and papers.  The course will also include 4 programming assignments using Apache open source tools, i.e. Tika and Lucene and/or Nutch.  

1. Quiz - 40 points
2. Homework - 40 points
3. Project - 20 points

**Final Project** Homework assignments culminate in a final project. Students will engage in a team or individual projects to leverage the opensource projects to facilitate their project development. **Successful completion of the course project is a requirement for passing this course.**

## Grading Scale

* A: 94 to 100
* A-: 90 to 93
* B+: 85 to 89
* B: 80 to 84 **Graduate students will receive NC (No Credit) for scores below 80**
* B-: 77 to 79
* C+: 74 to 76
* C: 70 to 73 **Undergraduates will receive NC (No Credit) for scores below 70**

## ADA Statement

Reasonable accommodation will be provided to any student who is registered with the Office of Students with Disabilities and requests needed accommodation.

## Academic Integrity

Cheating on assignments and exams will not be tolerated. All parties involved will receive a grade of **F** for the course and be reported to the Computer Science Department.
