# Homework 3

## Objectives

* Implement an index algorithm
* Implement a ranking algorithm

## Data Source

Your team will need to use this as the data source: [Document Collections](http://www.search-engines-book.com/collections).  We are only interested in the internal links ("same server") of the documents.

Note that this data is **large** and it is unlikely that your team can consume and perform complex ranking/analysis without some sort of optimizations.  The specific method for optimization is up to your team to decide.

## Writing your index program

To do the indexing, your software will need to "crawl" the web server, pull the data, perform and extract terms.  While doing the indexing, you can in fact, perform additional "scoring" on the terms and documents themselves.  For example, TFIDF.  A reminder again on the definition of TFIDF:

> Short for term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is often used as a weighting factor in information retrieval and text mining.

## Writing your ranking program

With a separate program, your task is to perform link analysis on the document collection that you have gathered.  The purpose of link analysis is to score the "value" of a document bases on its relationship to other documents.  For the purpose of the assignment you can restrict documents to only that are within the same server.

## Grading Rubric

* Demonstration of the index design and implementation
  * What is your indexing strategy?
  * What is your frequency/statistical analysis?
* Discussion of your ranking algorithm
  * Intrinsic ranking
  * Link analysis algorithm
