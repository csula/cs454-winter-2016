# Homework 4

## Objectives

* Present an user interface
* Tie in previous assignments

## User interface

Your team will put together a simple user interface that lets the users query the system and it should return list (and links) to documents containing the search term.

It is not required but we suggest that you provide a web interface.  However, do not spend too much time on the UI itself.

Some things to consider (if you want the 4 points):

* Ability to do boolean logic, e.g. query for `dog AND cat` or `dog OR cat`
* Do near distance ranking (as discussed in the class today)
* Search recommendation (i.e. completion)

## Grading Rubric

* The assignment will be evaluated based on the interface that returns the correct result.  This is contingent on getting the previous assignments working.
