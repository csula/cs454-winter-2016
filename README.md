#### 1/9/2016

Welcome to the first day of class.  Here are a few questions students might have about the course:

* What is the meeting time and location?  We will meet every Saturday from  9:10 to 13:00 session at ASCB 132.
* Will there be a quiz next week?  No, the first quiz will be given out the third week of class.
* What is expected for next week's class?  Please make sure that you can get `gradle` and the development environment fully working.
* Is the text book required for the course?  It does not contain required readings (we will read papers instead).  However, it will serve as a good reference for materials we cover in class.  Ultimately, it is up to you to decide.

Finally, please register your team before the end of Week 2 [here](http://goo.gl/forms/5m8DoQySO5).
